# A Wizard's Spring Hike

Source code for _A Wizard's Spring Hike_, a Sokoban-inspired puzzle game made in 72 hours for [Ludum Dare 55 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/a-wizards-spring-hike) (theme: Summoning). 

This was my first ever game jam submission. Due to the 72h deadline, the game was rather rushed and unpolished (espeically towards the end), and several ideas I had didn't make it to the final submission. 
This repository includes several post-deadline bugfixes, but no new features are added.

##### Acknowledgements
The following titles served as major inspiration for this game:
- _A Monster's Expedition_: Inspired the game's title and Sokoban mechanics. The working title of my game was "A Wizard's Expedition" (as reflected in repo name).
- _PÃ¢querette Down the Bunburrow_: Another Sokoban-like inspiration. Got me so addicted to the genre that I decided to make a Sokoban puzzle game before the jam's theme was revealed.
